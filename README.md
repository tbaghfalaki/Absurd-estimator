# Absurd-estimator
## Bayesian estimators as preferred  alternatives  to  those of frequentist
### Mojtaba Ganjali and Taban Baghfalaki (2023) 
In this paper, some more examples are given to underline the use of the Bayesian approach where the frequentist approach does not provide a solution to the problem at hand or gives an estimate that does not preserve the range of the estimand. This is known as __producing absurd estimates__ in the classical approach. In these examples, sometimes analytical Bayesian solutions may be found, and sometimes applications of the software Winbugs or R may give Bayesian numerical solutions.
